# This file specifies relative URLs to be redirected.  (Normally,
# you should follow <http://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI.html>,
# but if you *have* to change your URLs, you should at least
# redirect the old ones.)
# 
# Entries are of the format `<old-url> -> <new-url>`.  Lines
# starting with a `#` are ignored as comments.  Lines may be
# broken before and/or after the arrow.  You may also use an
# equals sign instead of a hyphen.
#
# This file is read by `_static/redirect.php`.  To use it, tell
# your server to use that PHP script as the 404 handler.  The
# `redirect.php` script will send 404.html, if available, if no
# redirect is available for the requested URL.
